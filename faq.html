            Is this a good trip for kids? What are the age ranges you allow?
          </h5>
          <p>
            Absolutely this is a good trip for children of all ages. We have
            found however that children over the age of 8 seem to enjoy it more
            overall (And parents especially enjoy it more if their children are
            all over 8). A common concern we get from parents is that their
            children will be bored stuck on a boat for hours at a time.
            Surprisingly we deal with very few bored children of any age. The
            areas we are rafting through are some of the most beautiful in the
            world, and you never know what you might see around any corner. Not
            to mention the rapids which keep things very interesting. Each boat
            also comes equipped with a guide.

          <h5>
            Is whitewater rafting safe? I don't even know how to swim! Can I
            still come?
          </h5>
          <p>
            As with all adventure sports, there is an inherent and assumed
            element of risk. To help ensure your safety, our guides are all
            certified in Wilderness First aid and all start with at least 3
            years of rafting experience. The most common injuries are sunburns
            and injuries that occur on land. Everyone on commercial rafting
            trips wears coast guard approved life vest or personal flotation
            device (PFD). Many non swimmers go on rafting trips and have a great
            time. Your guide will give you an in depth and engaging safety talk
            before your trip begins explaining what you should prepare for and
            do in the event that you fall out of the raft.

          <h5>What is included in the trip?</h5>
          <p>
            We will provide all necessary camping equipment. This includes a
            sleeping bag, foam pad, waterproof duffle bag, small waterproof day
            bag, tent and a cot, eating utensils and camping chair. <br />
            We provided water and lemonade during the day. Coffee, tea and hot
            chocolate are provided during the morning and evening hours. You may
            bring beer, liquor and soft drinks (in reasonable amounts, 2 cans
            per day). You may purchase these items either the night before the
            trip, or on your way to the put-in. 3 meals per day, plus snacks

          <h5>What do I need to bring?</h5>
          <p>
            The most effective way to plan for temperature and weather changes
            in the Canyon is to be prepared for both hot & dry and cold & wet
            Rain jacket and rain pants- do not bring ponchos Quick dry shirts
            and shorts long sleeve cotton shirt and pants- helps keep you cooler
            on hot days. Button down shirts provide more sun protection on the
            neck Light Weight Cotton Pant, Nylon Pant or Sarong the best thing
            for men to wear are swim trunks as shorts if you are cold natured,
            bring polypropylene long underwear top and bottom Women wear swim
            suits or quick dry underwear and sport bras as a base layer during
            the day. Over the base layer, wear a pair of quick dry shorts and
            the shirt of your choice (polypropylene if you are cold, cotton if
            you are hot).

          <h5>What is so great about whitewater rafting anyway?</h5>
          <p>
            Are you kidding me! What's not great about whitewater
            rafting!...Let's describe a common day on the river. <br />
            Arise in the soft light of the early morning after a night spent
            sleeping under a beautiful starry sky. Have a hearty warm breakfast
            of fresh blueberry pancakes or omelets to order, then pack your
            things and prepare for the day. The day is filled with some
            combination of swift water, rapids, calms, hikes, history, geology,
            stories, and more good food. We try to hit camp around 4 or 5, after
            setting up your cot you can relax with a good book or good company
            by the river.

          <h5>How far in advance should I book my trip?</h5>
          <p>
            If you have specific dates you need, we recommend booking a year in
            advance. If you can be more flexible 6 months in advance is usually
            sufficient.
