      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>
        When you talk about the best destination to do whitewater rafting
        everyone would mention first places like Wyoming, Idaho, Oregon, or
        Alaska, but I believe Utah has top destinations to practice this sport.
        Our purpose is to spread the word and show everyone around the world why
        Utah should be their top destimnatin to do raftng. The purpose for this
        website is to share information about the different places where you can
        practice rafting, and get the attention of tourits.

      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>
        My target audience would be people with an age range between 18-40 which
        are probably the ages of the people who practice rafting the most. We
        want to target families and individuals that are whiling to spend money
        in a high level experience. The website will provide easy access to
        finding a booking the best experience based on their budget and
        interests. We wont try to target an specific financial target since our
        purpose is to provide access to any kind of budgets to come to Utah and
        do rafting. Our main focus will be to develope a functional website that
        our users can acess from a computer or a mobile device.
